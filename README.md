# music-charts-dashboard

A music dashboard synthesizing data from multiple streaming services to visualize the most popular music around the world.

## Current Progress

\- Revamped the original Canvas draft and instead made the Data Flow visual that depicts how data will ultimately flow to the music dashboard

&nbsp;	- This is "on paper", i.e. before coding has been done, but I wanted a roadmap to be established for both myself and for documentation purposes

\- Replaced API terminology to reflect standard vocabulary (versus what I was originally calling it)

\- Refined the 'Project Process Steps' note

\- Researched and integrated how the 'ytmusicapi' Python package will be used to complement Spotify's API for the music dashboard

\- Narrowed scope of the dashboard to just reflect Top Tracks and Top Artists in the available countries (via YouTube Music)

\- The first pass of designing the SQLite database schema was completed
