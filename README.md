# music-charts-dashboard
A music dashboard synthesizing data from multiple streaming services to visualize the most popular music around the world.

## Current Progress
- Refined scope of dashboard to just working with artist/track/release data, along with country and time attributes to filter the data with. This was from an original idea of also being able to have a 'genre' attribute, but it (unfortunately) turns out that genre tagging music is incredibly messy, even among the major streaming services; it's simply not reliable nor complete.

- Feature list drafted.

- Dashboard concept was sketched out in an Obsidian Canvas file. This will come in handy as the exact API calls and data sources for each feature can be visually referenced.

- Various API sources conceptually refined.
