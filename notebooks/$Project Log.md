## **Project Log**

#### 7/17/2025
- Polished [[Data Flow visual]]
	- condensed entities
	- straightened and aligned boxes

#### 7/16/2025
- Finished [[Data Flow visual]]
- Finished first draft of the database schema
#### 7/15/2025
- Started an ETL process visual

#### 7/9/2025
- Researched the `ytmusicapi` Python library and its capabilities. 
	- Unfortunately, a YouTube Music Premium subscription is going to be required to get song titles from global and by-country charts, and
	- Only artists and their standings will be able to be returned without a Premium subscription
- <font color="#00b050"> So obviously the question is, do I move forward using these limitations or reduce the scope of the dashboard?</font>
	- I think getting the top tracks is a pretty critical part of the dashboard and thus a subscription is going to have to be needed for a couple months to at least get some solid data to store
- 'Top Releases' as a feature dropped from the scope of the project - not feasible from data sources, and project needs to move on
- Confirmed the exact API calls and responses in the context of inputs and outputs for the dashboard. Theoretically, everything makes sense so far from a systems standpoint.

#### 6/26/2025
- made extensive additions to the [[Data Sources visual.canvas|Data Sources visual]] map
- found and used community plugins to enhance readability and design of the map
#### 6/25/2025 
- finally made the initial commit to GitHub
#### 6/23/2025
- started project outline on Canvas
- decided to separate out API notes into their own (atomic) notes for each call I want, so that they can be linked more efficiently and better visually
#### 6/18/2025
- finished dashboard concept - we'll call it the first draft
	- added track/release art space
	- moved some visualizations around
	- added a basic color scheme (white for headers, beige-yellow for values)
- **need to start pushing Git commits!**
#### 6/17/2025
- decided pursuing last.fm's genre tags wasn't going to be worth it. [[$Project Insights-Mistakes-Frustrations]]
- finished most of the dashboard's initial visual concept
#### 6/12/2025
- made an outline of visualizations and features for dashboard using other music streaming services' as inspiration
- explored MusicBrainz API and capability for enhancing the dashboard (namely artist country origin)

## **Backlog**
