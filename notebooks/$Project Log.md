- [ ] make an outline of visualizations and features of dashboard
- [x] ~~take notes on Spotify API~~

### 6/23/2025
- started project outline on Canvas
- decided to separate out API notes into their own (atomic) notes for each call I want, so that they can be linked more efficiently and better visually

### 6/18/2025
- finished dashboard concept - we'll call it the first draft
	- added track/release art space
	- moved some visualizations around
	- added a basic color scheme (white for headers, beige-yellow for values)
- **need to start pushing Git commits!**
### 6/17/2025
- decided pursuing last.fm's genre tags wasn't going to be worth it. [[$Project Insights-Mistakes-Frustrations]]
- finished most of the dashboard's initial visual concept

### 6/12/2025
- made an outline of visualizations and features for dashboard using other music streaming services' as inspiration
- explored MusicBrainz API and capability for enhancing the dashboard (namely artist country origin)

## Backlog

- [ ] what exactly is the MVP?
- [ ] build technical map of how the two APIs will be joined
- [ ] sketch technical diagram of dashboard
- [ ] explore the 'ytmusicapi' Python library more and see if it'd be a net positive for the project ([sigma67/ytmusicapi: Unofficial API for YouTube Music](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi))
- [x] ~~install last.fm~~
- [x] ~~take notes on last.fm API~~
