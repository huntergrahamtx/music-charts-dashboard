*Preceding step:* [[3. Search For Item() Spotify API Calls]]
*Following step:* [[5. Assemble all stored API responses for insertion into the database]]

> [!todo] Step 4 Objective
> Using stored `Spotify Track ID` and `Spotify Artist ID` from the previous calls, get each track and artist's information using the `Get Track()` or `Get Artist()` calls, parse the responses, and store the relevant metrics.

### Step 4a) Make the `Get Track()` call to retrieve track data
- [ ] Using same code as Step [[3. Search For Item() Spotify API Calls#Step 3a) Make the `Search For Item()` calls for tracks]] but for `Get Track()`
	- [ ] store all metrics received if no error





### Step 4b) Make the `Get Artist()` call to retrieve artist data
- [ ] Repeat [[3. Search For Item() Spotify API Calls#Step 3b) Make the `Search For Item()` calls for artists]] but for `Get Artist()`.
