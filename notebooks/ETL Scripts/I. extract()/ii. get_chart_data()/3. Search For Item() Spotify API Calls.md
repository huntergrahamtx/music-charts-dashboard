*Preceding step:* [[2. Make Get_Charts() YouTube Music API call and parse responses]]
*Following step:* [[4. Get Track(), Get Artist() Spotify API Calls]]

> [!todo] Step 3 Objective
> Make the `Search For Item()` Spotify API calls for both tracks and artists, using the previously stored responses from the YouTube Music `Get_Charts()` API call. For both types of responses, parse each response and store the `Spotify Track ID` or `Spotify Artist ID`.

### Step 3a) Make the `Search For Item()` calls for tracks
- [ ] create batch call variable
- [ ] loop `for` each country:
	- [ ] reset batch call variable
		- [ ] loop `for` each track
			- [ ] store track names in batch call variable
	- [ ] `try` block
		- [ ] make batch call, specifying just the Spotify Track ID in the call arguments
		- [ ] store the Track IDs for each track in their respective dictionary value
		- [ ] implement short delay
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] `except` Rate Limit Error
			- [ ] check if response is "Retry After ..."
				- [ ] log which country and its overall position in the dictionary
				- [ ] execute exponential delay counter
				- [ ] iterate exponential delay counter value +1


### Step 3b) Make the `Search For Item()` calls for artists
- [ ] Same as above, but for artists
