## **Insights**

### 6/17/2025
- I need to start taking more notes on my thoughts/feelings/insights/mistakes throughout this project's journey, not only to help me learn better, but also for:
	- posterity's sake, so that I can retain the lessons in the future
	- show potential employers more about how I think
	- using Obsidian more extensively through additional note-taking. I'm committing to using Obsidian for at least the next 12 months, because I hear that it's not until you start accumulating significant amounts of notes that you start seeing it's true potential in helping you learn (I hope that's correct...)
- I really wanted to incorporate genre tagging but last.fm's tag system is very imperfect for what I want to do (there's no hierarchy, namely). I'm going to do more research on what could replace it, but I might just drop genre tagging altogether. 
- I just noticed that there's an "unofficial" API for YouTube Music via a Python library, and there might be some useful features or complement or replace existing ones I've sketched out.

## **Decisions**
### 6/17/2025
- Abandoned genre tagging with last.fm. Too unreliable (last.fm tagging), no evidence that it's well-correlated with Spotify's popularity metric. The juice ain't worth the squeeze for this feature, at least as of now.

## **Struggles/Frustrations**

## **Mistakes**
### 6/25/2025
- I wish I committed to GitHub earlier!
