## **Insights**

### 7/16/2025
- After a lot of testing, the Excalidraw community plugin for Obsidian, a mindmapping plugin, is definitely superior to Obsidian's native Canvas feature, which is much more limiting. I played around and spent too much time going back and forth between the two to build out the Data Flow visual, but I'm really happy with how it turned out, at least for a first pass, in Excalidraw; I wouldn't have been able to make it look so clean in Canvas.
### 6/26/2025
- I am thoroughly enjoying Obsidian and its Canvas note type for visualization the project coming together. I wouldn't be surprised if multiple canvases are made. I wish I had used this software sooner!

### 6/17/2025
- I need to start taking more notes on my thoughts/feelings/insights/mistakes throughout this project's journey, not only to help me learn better, but also for:
	- posterity's sake, so that I can retain the lessons in the future
	- show potential employers more about how I think
	- using Obsidian more extensively through additional note-taking. I'm committing to using Obsidian for at least the next 12 months, because I hear that it's not until you start accumulating significant amounts of notes that you start seeing it's true potential in helping you learn (I hope that's correct...)
- I really wanted to incorporate genre tagging but last.fm's tag system is very imperfect for what I want to do (there's no hierarchy, namely). I'm going to do more research on what could replace it, but I might just drop genre tagging altogether. 
- I just noticed that there's an "unofficial" API for YouTube Music via a Python library, and there might be some useful features or complement or replace existing ones I've sketched out.

## **Decisions**

### 7/16/2025
- Using Excalidraw, not Canvas, for all visual sketching go-forward
### 7/9/2025
- Viewing Top Releases as a feature unfortunately needs to be abandoned as the YouTube Music API doesn't have a Top Releases chart. As much as I wanted to included this feature it's not critical to the project and I need to move on.

### 6/17/2025
- Abandoned genre tagging with last.fm. Too unreliable (last.fm tagging), no evidence that it's well-correlated with Spotify's popularity metric. The juice ain't worth the squeeze for this feature, at least as of now.

## **Struggles/Frustrations**
### 7/9/2025
- The `ytmusicapi` library is great but YouTube Music itself is limiting only top artists by country or globally for free; a YouTube Music Premium subscription is required to fetch the songs. I don't mind paying $15 for the next few months for the project, but my intention was to have this project live as long as possible. So, a decision needs to be made about how to music forward, and time is of the essence.

## **Mistakes**
### 6/25/2025
- I wish I committed to GitHub earlier!
